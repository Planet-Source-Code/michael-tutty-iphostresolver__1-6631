## IPHostResolver


</div>

### Description

Allows you to look up a DNS entry by name (www.whatever.com => 100.100.0.1) or by IP (100.100.0.1 => www.whatever.com). Includes some code found right here on PSC!
 
### More Info
 
Either a host name or the IP address

You should have a TCP stack installed before trying this (i.e., can you surf?), or it'll puke.

Either an IP address or a host name (are you seeing a pattern here?)

You may become dizzy or irritable if you use this class. Make sure to drink lots of water, and eat your vegetables.
